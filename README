Why play nethack in a dusty old terminal session when you be "webhacking" through
a cutting-edge AJAX-ified web portal!?

Introducing WEBHACK!

It spawns nethack sessions in PTYs hooked up to FIFOs via I/O multiplexing!

It submits moves and retrieves screen updates via AJAX!

It renders ANSI escape codes into an 25x80 html table, one character per cell!

It probably only works with Firefox OSX keyboard events!

It is completely useless and kind of insane!

Happy hacking!
